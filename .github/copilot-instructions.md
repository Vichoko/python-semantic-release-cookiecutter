* The project is hosted on git repository:
  * https://github.com/Vichoko/ProperTea.git

, so pay attention to path formats and OS-specific commands.
  * E.g. don't chain commands with `&&` 
* The cloud provider is GCP, so pay attention to GCP-specific commands.
* The project uses Poetry for dependency management, so use Poetry commands to manage dependencies.
* Every feature must be implemented in a separate branch named `feature/<feature-name>`.
  * Before pushing something to a feature branch, make sure to check in which brand you are right now
